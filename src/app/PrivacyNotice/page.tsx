          Our website and/or service does not intend to collect data about
          website visitors who are younger than 16 years of age unless they
          have permission from their parents or guardian. However, we cannot
          check whether a visitor is older than 16. We therefore advise
          parents to be involved in their children's online activities in
          order to prevent data about children from being collected without
          parental consent. If you are convinced that we have collected
          personal information about a minor without this consent, please
          contact us at info@raimonvibe.com, and we will delete this
          information.
